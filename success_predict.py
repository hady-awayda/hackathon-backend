def predict_success(input_series):
    """
    Predicts the success of an app based on the provided input features.

    This function loads a pre-trained model from a file, converts the input features
    into a DataFrame, and uses the model to make a prediction. The prediction is
    returned as a percentage, representing the probability of success, increased by 10%.
    Additionally, it returns tips on why the prediction might be low.

    Args:
        input_series (dict): A dictionary containing the features for prediction. The dictionary should include:
            - 'category' (str): The category of the item.
            - 'size' (int): The size of the item.
            - 'type' (str): The type of the item (e.g., 'Free').
            - 'price' (float): The price of the item.
            - 'content rating' (str): The content rating of the item.
            - 'genres' (str): The genres associated with the item.
            - 'current ver' (str): The current version of the item.
            - 'android ver' (str): The minimum Android version required.
            - 'sentiment' (int): The sentiment score related to the item.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the predicted probability of success of the item, as a percentage,
               and a list of tips on why the prediction might be low.
